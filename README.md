# Suricata Log Rotation Configuration

This repository provides a log rotation configuration for Suricata logs using the `logrotate` utility. The log rotation helps manage the size of the logs and keeps them organized for efficient storage and analysis.

## Configuration Details

The log rotation configuration is defined in the `/etc/logrotate.d/suricata` file. The file contains individual log rotation rules for different Suricata log files.

### Log Files

The following log files are included in the rotation configuration:

- `fast.log`: Contains fast log entries.
- `stats.log`: Stores statistical information generated by Suricata.
- `suricata.log`: Main log file capturing Suricata events and alerts.
- `suricata-start.log`: Records the start of the Suricata process.
- `eve.json`: JSON formatted log file containing event data.

### Configuration Options

For each log file, the following configuration options are defined:

- `size`: Specifies the maximum size of the log file before rotation is triggered. In this configuration, the size is set to 1GB.
- `rotate`: Sets the number of rotated log files to keep. In this configuration, the last 5 rotated files are retained.
- `compress`: Enables compression of the rotated log files.
- `missingok`: Considers the absence of a log file as not an error.
- `notifempty`: Prevents rotation of an empty log file.
- `create`: Sets the permissions of the newly created log file. In this configuration, the log files are created with permissions `0640` and owned by the `root` user and group.
- `postrotate`: Defines the actions to be performed after log rotation. In this configuration, it sends a signal (`HUP`) to Suricata's process ID (PID) to notify it about the rotation. If the PID file is not found or Suricata is not running, the command is ignored.
- `endscript`: Marks the end of the post-rotation script section.

## Usage

To use this log rotation configuration:

1. Copy the contents of the `/etc/logrotate.d/suricata` file into your own logrotate configuration file or create a new file with the same contents.
2. Modify the configuration options if needed to suit your requirements.
3. Save the file.
4. Restart the logrotate service to apply the changes.

You can now enjoy automatic log rotation for your Suricata logs, ensuring efficient log management and storage.
